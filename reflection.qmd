As I expanded my single-page portfolio into a multi-page Quarto website, my use of large language models (LLMs) also evolved. First, I used an LLM to **brainstorm a site map** that goes beyond a résumé: Home/About, Resume/CV, Projects, Skills & Certifications, Leadership & Service, Contact, Reflection, and an Appendix. This step helped me clarify the **narrative flow** from who I am, to what I’ve done, to how I think.

What worked better as more pages were added was the LLM’s strength at generating **structured outlines and first drafts** for each page. For example, initial bullet points for project write-ups saved time, allowing me to focus on **evidence** (screenshots, numbers, and links) and on polishing language. I also asked the LLM for **accessibility and usability checks** (alt text, descriptive link text, headings, and contrast considerations), which raised the overall quality.

To ensure **authenticity and accuracy**, I kept a strict rule: every claim must be **mine to own**. I verified all numbers against my records and rewrote generic LLM phrasing into my **own voice**. Where the LLM suggested content I couldn’t substantiate, I removed it. I also made AI assistance clear and provided drafts in the Appendix as well. Lastly, I checked the site using the assignment rubric and course guidelines to ensure that pages, navigation, citations and reflections were included and made sense.

Concisely, the LLMs shortened the ideation and drafting process when I maintained control over facts, tone, and ethics. This collaboration led to a clearer story, better organization, and a website I can maintain as my MBA journey progresses.
